    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <h2> Who are you? </h2>
    <p> My name is Rae. I am 26 and live in Nanaimo. My favourite things are my dog, houseplants, and Taylor Swift. I work as a nanny and volunteer as a Girl Guides leader. I'm looking forward to this school year and can't wait to learn more about HTML and CSS. </p>
    <h2> Is it your first time in post-secondary education? </h2>
    <p> No, I've been in post-secondary before. I completed the Legal Administrative Assistant program at VIU in 2017, and then went on to do a brief stint in their Criminology program for a year or so afterwards. </p>
    <h2> Do you have any past experience creating websites? </h2>
    <p> Not really, no. I remember learning how to edit HTML as a child to customize my Neopets profile, but that's about as far as my coding knowledge goes. </p>
    <h2> Do you know any coding languages? </h2>
    <p> No, I understand super basic HTML as explained above, but that's about it. This is all pretty new to me, but I'm excited to learn! </p>
    <h2> What are your goals for this course? </h2>
    <p> I need this course for the Communication Design Diploma, however I am really interested in learning to code, and learning HTML and CSS is a great foundation to start on. </p>
